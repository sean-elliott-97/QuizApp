# QuizApp

This project is a quiz app. 
In this app users have 75 seconds to complete five multiple choice questions.
When users are finished with the quiz, they will be shown their score and can add their name and score to local storage.

When a user clicks the start button,
then a 75 second timer starts and he or she is presented with a question.

When a user answers a question,
Then he or she is presented with another question.

When a user answers a question incorrectly,
Then time is subtracted from the clock and points are subtracted from the score.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0,
Then the game is over.

When the game is over,
Then a user can save his or her initials and score.
